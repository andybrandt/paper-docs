# Andy's Lean Canvas Template

The Lean Canvas template is a worksheet for capturing and exploring early-stage business or product concepts.  The template is based on a methodology elaborated by Ash Maurya [in his blog](http://www.ashmaurya.com/2012/02/why-lean-canvas/) and in his book entitled *[Running Lean](http://www.runningleanhq.com/)*.  Ash's Lean Canvas is in turn based on [the Business Model Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas) as described in the book *[Business Model Generation](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/book)* developed by [Alex Osterwalder](http://www.businessmodelalchemist.com/) et al.
