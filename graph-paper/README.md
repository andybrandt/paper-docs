# Andy's Graph Paper Templates

Based on Rod's Graph Paper Templates I forked them from. I have just changed format to A4 + produced a version with more subtle lines (30% Gray). 

This directory contains templates for printable graph paper sheets in various formats.

These are available both as OpenDocument graphic (ODG) files (created with OpenOffice) and as Portable Document Format (PDF) exports, suitable for printing.

 * `quad-0.2in-lines-0.6gray` - letter-sized (8.5"x11") sheet containing a rectangular grid of 60%-gray lines spaced 0.2 inches apart. ([ODG](https://github.com/rodw/paper-forms/raw/master/graph-paper/quad-0.2in-lines-0.6gray.odg), [PDF](https://github.com/rodw/paper-forms/raw/master/graph-paper/quad-0.2in-lines-0.6gray.pdf))
 * `quad-0.2in-dots-0.6gray` - letter-sized (8.5"x11") sheet containing a rectangular grid of 60%-gray *dots* spaced 0.2 inches apart. ([ODG](https://github.com/rodw/paper-forms/raw/master/graph-paper/quad-0.2in-dots-0.6gray.odg), [PDF](https://github.com/rodw/paper-forms/raw/master/graph-paper/quad-0.2in-dots-0.6gray.pdf))
